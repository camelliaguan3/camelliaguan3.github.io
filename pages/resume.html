                        I serve on a team of 60+ consultants to supplement learning for ~500 students. During consulting and office hours, I troubleshoot students' computer and Python issues, and I also teach students during bi-weekly lab sections to ensure students are on track with lecture material. Another responsibility I have is grading assignments and exams and answering course forum questions on Ed Discussion.
