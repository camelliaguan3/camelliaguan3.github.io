            <h2> About Me </h2>

            <p>
                I"m very passionate about problem-solving, and I believe that computer science provides an incredible
                platform for tackling complex problems and making a positive impact on society.

                <br />
                <br />

                Throughout my time at Cornell, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects and engage in
                clubs and classes that have further fueled my passion for problem-solving. Some things I am involved in
                are the Society of Women Engineers at Cornell as the Communications Director, and CS 1110 as a
                Consultant.

                <br />
                <br />

                Besides programming and computer science, I have other passions, including creating art and trying new
                things. During the past summer (2023), I went overseas for the first time and studied abroad in Hong
                Kong, where I was able to adapt to an unfamiliar environment and experience a new culture.
