                <h3> Description </h3> 
                <p>
                    The Playful Plants Project at Cornell University aims to educate designers, planners, and facility managers about the value plants and natural features can add to their spaces. 
                    For this project, I followed a 2-phase development pattern that included design and then implementation.
                </p>

                <h3> Design/Planning </h3>
                <p>
                    I documented a design journey to identify audience goals, wireframe website designs, and plan out a database and formulate SQL queries.
                </p>

                <h3> Implementation </h3>
                <p>
                    The database was created via SQLite, and the server-side content rendering was conducted via PHP. The final implementation included a Consumer page and an Administrator page. The Consumer page allows users to browse, sort, and filter plants. Administrators of Playful Plants can also access the Administrator page, allowing them to edit plant entries that can then be viewed by consumers.

                <p>
                    The OCaml Piano is an open-ended, agile software development experience project created as part of CS 3110: Data Structures and Functional Programming.
                </p>

                <h3> Design/Planning </h3>
                <p>
                    The project was split into multiple files and functions, which were divided among the contributors.
                </p>

                <h3> Implementation </h3>
                <p>
                    The piano was built from scratch and consists of approximately 1000 lines of OCaml code, consisting of an interface, documentation, and testing.
