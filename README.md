# ENGRC 3025: Professional Website

## Purpose of Project
This repository was made for my ENGRC 3025 Final Project, in which I create a professional website that displays my skills, projects, and overall resume. This website will showcase the web development skills that I have learned, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Design Choices: Prototype + Wireframes

The wireframe and prototype of the website includes a home page, about page, and portfolio page. However, I realized that it did not have enough interactivity to my liking, and I also wanted the home page to be more eye-catching than I designed it to be, as audience retainment is a goal of mine. To fix this, 

A project requirement is that the website also have at least 4 pages or section, so another page will be added to satisfy this requirement, which will outline technical and soft skills from my resume, as well as work experience.
