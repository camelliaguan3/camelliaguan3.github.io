            <p> 
                I'm very passionate about problem-solving, and I believe that computer science provides an incredible platform for tackling complex problems and making a positive impact on society. Throughout my time at Cornell, I have had the opportunity to work on various projects and engage in clubs and classes that have further fueled my passion for problem-solving. 

                <br/>
                <br/>

                Ultimately, I'd love to work in a role related to software development and engineering to create solutions to real-world problems and exercise my fundamentals in programming and problem-solving.
